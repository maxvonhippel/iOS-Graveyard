## Max's App Graveyard

**I began coding around age 14.**  Since then, I have made over a dozen apps for iOS and Android, both as an indie developer and as a subcontractor for others.  I've improved quite a bit at coding - my indie apps had been downloaded over 20,000 times on iOS before I learned the word "pointer".  **And now I've decided to kill my current library of iOS apps.**

Apple is removing support for 32-bit apps in iOS 11, and since I did the majority of my iOS coding in high school, my apps are almost all 32-bit.  I could update them - but they no longer sell well, and I do not think they are a good representation of my current coding abilities.  I would rather spend my time working on exciting new projects, rather than try to play catch-up with code I wrote during the weekends in High School.

That said, open-sourcing code is a groovy thing to do, and maybe others will find some of this interesting or useful.  In my initial attempts at coding, I used a lot of open source code from other people - maybe most notably the Sol weather app - and so much of that can be found within this repository.  But there is also some fairly interesting and original code of my own - maybe most notably in Pod Box, my latest, and ultimately unreleased, iOS app.

Regardless, if you gain anything from this code, let me know.  Feel free to use it however you want within the limits of the law and good taste.  You can profit off of any of the code I wrote in this repository so long as your product represents a significant improvement (addition of functionality) on the work of mine that you use, and/or serves an entirely orthogonal purpose/utility.
